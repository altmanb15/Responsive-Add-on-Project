            <h3>About Willow Winter</h3>
            <p>
              She started writing after having her little girl, December of
              2015. All during her pregnancy with her she read. She only wanted
              to read romance novels and she read everything she could get her
              hands on. She would read a book a day-times two. In Januany, she
              was staying up late with the baby and just was thinkging of all
              the stories. They came to her constantly. She finally sat down
              anad just started writing, She always wanted to do it so she
              figured, why not?
            </p>
            <p>
              She never thought she would reach the point of success. It's
              insane to her that she has connected with so many readers.
            </p>
            <p>
              And she loves each and every one of them for all their support.
              She stated that some days are HARD.She has her little girl during
              the day and she writes at night. Some days are just simply
              exhausting and then she hears from a reader and it motivates her
              to push though and keep writing. W. Winters couldn't be more
              grateful for her wonderful career.
