            <h3>About Willow Winter</h3>
            <p>
              She started writing after having her little girl, December of
              2015. All during her pregnancy with her she read. She only wanted
              to read romance novels and she read everything she could get her
              hands on. She would read a book a day-times two. In Januany, she
              was staying up late with the baby and just was thinkging of all
              the stories. They came to her constantly. She finally sat down
              anad just started writing, She always wanted to do it so she
              figured, why not?
            </p>
            <p>
              She never thought she would reach the point of success. It's
              insane to her that she has connected with so many readers.
            </p>
            <p>
              And she loves each and every one of them for all their support.
              She stated that some days are HARD.She has her little girl during
              the day and she writes at night. Some days are just simply
              exhausting and then she hears from a reader and it motivates her
              to push though and keep writing. W. Winters couldn't be more
              grateful for her wonderful career.

                <p>
                  I own this town. The deals, the cash flow, the corruption – I
                  decide it all. Blood and violence taints everything I claim.
                  She was a constant through it all and she never knew how badly
                  I needed her. Just a touch would singe and soothe. Just a look
                  would tempt and torment. She was too good for this world. I
                  was too much of a bastard to push her away. And so she became
                  my escape and my addiction. It was only a matter of time
                  before the danger bled into what we had. I should’ve known
                  better than to indulge. I should’ve known better than to let
                  her fall for me. There isn’t anything I touch that doesn’t
                  crumble into dust and ash. Touching Laura was her downfall.
                  Problem was, it was mine, too.
